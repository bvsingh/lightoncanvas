        <h2>Objective </h2>
        <p>Downloading thousands of photographs from multiple memory cards can be a considerable challenge, particularly as each card must be downloaded individually, even when using several card readers. Furthermore, the initial editing process - rating, deleting, and detailed viewing - demands substantial time and effort. This software is specifically designed to assist photographers in reducing this workload by significantly expediting both the downloading process and the first pass edit, all within a single application. </p>

        <p>This version of FirstPass has been re-imagined using SwiftUI and Swift. </p>

        <h2>Unique features of FirstPass </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>The first MacApp store application on Mac to enable image download from multiple sources to multiple destinations. </li>
            <li>Works with shared devices to enable download over a network. </li>
            <li>Provides a fast and clean interface to do a “first pass” editing of images. </li>
            <li>Frees up the user’s time by handling multiple downloads at the same time without requiring the user to swap the cards in and out of a card reader or starting the download manually for each card. </li>
            <li>Can be configured to automatically start downloading when a device (or multiple devices) are plugged in. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Quick start guide</h2>
        <p>FirstPass has a single window type. User can create multiple windows and can browse different folders or download different cards. Same window can also be used to download multiple cards, each download triggered sequentially. </p>

        <img src="FirstPassManualImages/GeneralSettings.png" width="800">

        <p>General pane is used for setting external editor.</p>
        
        <b>Download</b>
        <img src="FirstPassManualImages/DownloadSettings.png" width="800">

        <p>Download pane is used to set download destinations and image renaming tokens. Here user can set multiple download destinations. User can set primary and secondary destinations. User can also set the tokens for creating folders for primary and secondary downloads. Tokens can also be set for file renaming. Along with provided tokens user can add their own e.g. space, “_” etc.</p>

        <b>Colours</b>
        <img src="FirstPassManualImages/ColourSettings.png" width="800">

        <p>All elements in sidebar has coloured icons associated with them. There is a default set of colours, shown above. Users can use this pane to change the colours.</p>

        <h3>File Renaming</h3>
        <p>Along with renaming files while they are being downloaded from a camera or a card, they can also be renamed while viewing them in gallery. This does not move the files to different folder, just renames them in place. User can use all the same tokens as used for files while downloading from a camera or a card.

In the image gallery user can select few images and right click to bring up renaming panel. User can provide tokens, specify which date to use if the date tokens are used and provide starting sequence number if renamed files result in name conflicts.</p>

        <p><b>Note:</b> <em>After entering each word user must press enter to tokenize it. All known tokens should be dragged from collection to the renaming field.</em></p>
